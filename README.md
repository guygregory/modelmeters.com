# Model Meters - Azure AI Foundry Pricing Explorer

[modelmeters.com](https://modelmeters.com) provides a simple front-end to the [Azure Retail Prices API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices), automatically downloading and enriching Azure AI pricing data with AI-generated summaries and insights.

## Solution Overview

Model Meters combines several Azure and GitHub services to create an automated pricing intelligence solution:

### Architecture Flow

1. **Daily Data Collection**: GitHub Actions automatically downloads the latest Azure pricing data using the Azure Retail Prices API
2. **Data Processing**: The raw pricing data is split into segments based on the pricing `startDate` value
3. **AI Enhancement**: Azure OpenAI (via Azure AI Foundry) generates intelligent summaries of the latest pricing changes, using Model Context Protocol (MCP) to include Microsoft Learn documentation
4. **Web Deployment**: The processed data and summaries are automatically deployed to Azure Static Web Apps using GitHub Actions
5. **User Interface**: A responsive web interface allows users to explore pricing data and AI-generated insights

### Key Agentic AI Features

- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Runs daily at midnight UTC to check for pricing updates
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Leverages Azure OpenAI to generate concise, factual summaries of pricing changes grouped by model provider
- **Documentation Integration**: Uses [Microsoft Learn MCP Server](https://github.com/microsoftdocs/mcp) to automatically include relevant documentation links
- **Human-in-the-loop**: As AI summaries are stored in markdown format, this allows for quick and easy human review (and potentially AI agent review)
